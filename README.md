Sapphire DKS is a software recreation of Wooting's **"Dynamic Keystrokes"** feature, designed specifically for the game osu!

It comes pre-packaged with an `internal customizable randomization` as well as a `hold to activate key`, a `hide menu key`, a full `stream proof` setting, and a special functionality that is a special adaptation of the DKS feature.

Recently, the #3 Bancho player 'Cloutiful' was banned for using this feature on the Wooting keyboard. The only reason he was caught was due to his holdtimes being abnormal, since Wooting does nothing to randomize them. We have created this to work with EVERY keyboard and be completely undetected during manual review. As of now (6/21/2024) this is currently **fully undetected** and can be used on Bancho (as well as private servers). This may change in the future depending on anti-cheat updates.

# DKS Configuration Section
- __**DKS Key**__: This is the key you want to be affected by the DKS mode & the non-DKS mode.
- __**Input key delay**__: This is the duration of the delay used before sending any artificial input.
- __**Hold key delay**__: This is the duration for how long the artificial input will be sent for.

# Misc Configuration Section
- __**Input randomization**__: This is a percentage slider that controls the randomness of the `Input key delay`.
- __**Hold randomization**__: This is a percentage slider that controls the randomness of the `Hold key delay`.
- __**DKS mode (enabled)**__: The software will only affect the key you have set on the `DKS Key` & when that key is pressed, the input will be sent when you lift up on the key, rather than when the key was pressed down.
- __**DKS mode (disabled)**__: This is an adaptation of the DKS mode when enabled. This one requires you to have an `Alternate key`. When DKS mode is disabled, you will still use your primary DKS key to activate the alternate key, but when you do press your DKS key, it will send an input for whatever your alternate key input is. For example, if you have 'Z' as your DKS key & 'X' as your alternate key, you can simply press Z & when you let go of Z, it will send an X input for you automatically. The speed at which it sends the input and how long it sends the input for is based on the delays you have set.
- __**Alternate key**__: This is the secondary input that will be sent when you press your DKS key if DKS mode is disabled.
- __**Hold to activate**__: If a key is set, this key will need to be held down in order for the software to work even with DKS mode on or off.
- __**Hide menu**__: If a key is set, when the key is pressed, the menu will hide from you and any capture device. If you would like to have a more stream-proof alternative while still being able to configure the menu, there is a `trueStreamerMode` setting in the config.json file. Set this to true and you can still see the menu while anyone you may be streaming to cannot.
